code study

<p>Sometimes you have to be your own hero. 
<p>Do something today that your future self will thank you for. 
<p>Talk is cheap, Show me the code.
<p>God helps those who help themselves. 
<p>The good seaman is known in bad weather.
<p>Nothing really matters except to live or die.
<p>It's okay to have flaws, which makes me real. 
<p>People cry, not because they're weak. It's because they've been strong for too long. 
<p>Trust is like an eraser. It gets smaller and smaller after every mistake.
